        <div class="about-me">
            <p>
                Sachin Tendulkar, in full Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar, (born April 24, 1973, Bombay [Mumbai], India), Indian
                professional cricket player, considered by many to be one of the greatest batsmen of all time. In 2012
                he became the first cricketer to score 100 centuries (100 runs in a single innings) in international
                play.
            </p>
            <p>Tendulkar was given his first bat when he was 11 years of age. As a 14-year-old, he used it to score 329
                out of a world-record stand of 664 in a school match. A year later he scored a century on his
                first-class debut for Bombay (Mumbai), and at age 16 years 205 days he became India’s youngest Test
                (international) cricketer, making his debut against Pakistan in Karachi in November 1989. When he was 18
                he scored two centuries in Australia (148 in Sydney and 114 in Perth), and in 1994 he scored 179 against
                the West Indies. In August 1996, at age 23, Tendulkar was made captain of his country’s team.</p>
            <p>Although India was defeated in the semifinals of the 1996 World Cup, Tendulkar emerged as the
                tournament’s top run scorer, with 523 runs. In 1998 he was chosen for the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award,
                the highest award given to an Indian athlete, for his outstanding performance in the 1997–98 season.
                India was defeated by Australia in the 1999 World Cup, failing to advance past the round of six, and was
                soundly defeated by both Australia and South Africa in series later that year. In the 2003 World Cup,
                however, Tendulkar helped his team advance as far as the finals. Though India was again defeated by
                Australia, Tendulkar, who averaged 60.2, was named the man of the tournament.</p>

    <hr>
    <div class="about">
        <div class="about-me">
            <p>Sachin Tendulkar was the most complete batter of his time, the most prolific run-maker of all time, and
                arguably the biggest cricket icon the game has ever known.</p>
            <p>His batting was based on the purest principles: perfect balance, economy of movement, precision in
                stroke-making, and that intangible quality given only to genius batters - anticipation. If he didn't
                have a signature stroke (though the upright, back-foot punch comes close) it was because he was
                proficient at so many and could pull them out at will.</p>
            <p>He holds the record for most hundreds in both Tests and ODIs - remarkable, considering he didn't score
                his first ODI hundred until his 79th match. At just under 37 years of age, he made the first
                double-century in one-day cricket. In 2012, a month short of his 39th birthday, he became the first
                player to score 100 international centuries, which, like Bradman's batting average, might be a mark that
                lasts for ever. Later that year, though, he announced his retirement from ODIs after a disappointing 18
                months in international cricket. And on November 16, 2013, he retired from Test cricket after a
                memorable 200th Test, against West Indies.</p>
